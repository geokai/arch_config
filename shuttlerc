# Lines in this file starting with # are comments.
#
#
# This file is divided into paragraphs, each specifying the bindings to
# be used when the keyboard focus is on a specific window.  The
# paragraph is introduced with a line starting with [.  That line
# contains the paragraph name (which is only used for debugging output
# to help you in editing this file) followed by ], followed by a regular
# expression.  When the title bar of the focused window matches the
# regular expression (see regex(7)), the bindings in the paragraph will
# be in effect.  The program tries these regular expressions in order,
# and the first match is used.

# If there is no regex on the line, like the [Default] line near the
# bottom, the paragraph acts as a default.  Any window title which does
# not match any regex will use the default bindings.  Any keys which are
# not specified in the paragraph which does match will use the default
# bindings for those keys.

# While you are working on regular expressions to match your window
# names, is is useful to see the window names and paragraph names which
# the program finds as you generate ShuttlePRO events.  Run the shuttle
# program in a terminal window and remove the comment character from the
# following line:

#DEBUG_REGEX

# Within a paragraph, key bindings are introduced with the name of the
# key or event being defined.  Keys are named K1 through K15.  Positions
# of the shuttle wheel are named S-7 through S-1 for counter-clockwise
# positions, S0 for the rest position in the center, and S1 through S7
# for the clockwise positions.  The jog wheel emits two events named JL
# and JR, for counter-clockwise and clockwise rotations respectively.

# The keys on the Contour Shuttle Pro v2 are arranged like this:
#
#          K1  K2  K3  K4
#        K5  K6  K7  K8  K9
#
#        K14     Jog    K15
#
#          K10        K11
#         K12          K13

# After the name of the key being bound, the remainder of the line is
# the sequence of X KeySyms which will be generated when that event is
# received.  Look up the KeySyms in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h.  In
# addition to the KeySym names found there, you can also use XK_Button_1
# for the left mouse button, XK_Button_2 for the middle mouse button,
# XK_Button_3 for the right mouse button, XK_Scroll_Up and
# XK_Scroll_Down for mouse scroll wheel events.  For sequences of one or
# more printable characters, you can just enclose them in double quotes.

# Each KeySym you specify will be pressed and released before the next
# KeySym is pressed.  If you wish a key to be held down, you can add a
# /D to the end of the KeySym.  For example:  XK_Shift_L/D,
# XK_Control_L/D or XK_Alt_L/D.  Such keys will be held down until you
# specify they should be released with a /U on the same KeySym name.
# They will all be released at the end of the binding anyway, so you
# usually won't have to use /U.

# Key bindings, whose names start with a K, allow for some extra
# options.  Since they generate separate events when pressed and
# released, you can control that as well.  Each non-modifier key is
# pressed and released in sequence except for the last which is not
# released until the shuttle key is released.  If you want to press more
# keys during the release sequence, you can put them after the special
# word "RELEASE".  Modifier keys specified with /D are released at the
# end of the press sequence, and re-pressed if there are any keys to be
# pressed after RELEASE.  If you don't want the modifier keys to be
# released (you want to use a ShuttlePRO key as Shift, for example) you
# can follow it with a /H instead of /D.

# If you want to see exactly how this file is parsed and converted into
# KeySym strokes, run the shuttle program in a terminal window and
# remove the comment character from the following line:

DEBUG_STROKES

# As one of the main reasons to use a ShuttlePRO is video editing, I've
# included a sample set of bindings for Cinelerra as an example.
